# Image-to-Monet-Project

This repository covers a implementation of a Cycle GAN architecture for this [Kaggle Contest](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/gan-getting-started).

## Architectures

You can find two implementations which only vary in batch size and used GPU. The first one, was a implementation using my local machine, an ASUS TUF with 3050 NVIDIA GeForce RTX. The second one, was in the kaggle environment using a P100 Grafic Card.

## Conclussions

In this implementation based in the tutorial giving in the notebook, a Cycle GAN was implemented, both implementations are completely functional and can be freely modified by the comunity. In future works, it is possible to change the network architecture and the hyperparameters such as the learning rate and number of layers.
